            <h2>What is Alzheimer's Disease?</h2>
            <p>Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that causes memory loss, confusion, and changes in behavior. It is the most common cause of dementia, affecting millions worldwide.</p>
            <p>Alzheimer's disease primarily affects the brain’s memory and cognitive functions. As the disease progresses, it leads to a gradual loss of independence, impacting a person's ability to perform daily activities. This condition is most commonly found in older adults, though early-onset Alzheimer’s can occur as well.</p>

    <!-- Symptoms Section -->
    <section class="section">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Symptoms of Alzheimer's</h2>
            <p>Alzheimer's symptoms usually develop slowly and worsen over time. The early signs are subtle and may be dismissed as part of the aging process. As the disease progresses, symptoms become more noticeable and interfere with daily activities.</p>
            <p>Common symptoms of Alzheimer's include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Memory loss, especially forgetting recently learned information</li>
                <li>Confusion with time or place</li>
                <li>Difficulty with language and communication</li>
                <li>Misplacing items and losing the ability to retrace steps</li>
                <li>Changes in mood, personality, or behavior</li>
                <li>Difficulty making decisions or solving problems</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As Alzheimer's advances, these symptoms become more pronounced and can lead to complete dependence on others for daily activities.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Diagnosis and Testing Section -->
    <section class="section">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Diagnosis & Testing</h2>
            <p>Diagnosing Alzheimer's disease can be challenging, especially in its early stages. There is no single test that can definitively diagnose Alzheimer's, but a combination of medical history, cognitive tests, and brain imaging can help doctors determine the presence of the disease.</p>
            <p>The diagnostic process generally includes the following steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Medical history:</strong> Doctors will ask about symptoms, medical history, and family history of Alzheimer's or other dementia-related diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Cognitive testing:</strong> Standardized tests are used to evaluate memory, problem-solving abilities, and other cognitive functions.</li>
                <li><strong>Brain imaging:</strong> MRI or CT scans may be used to detect changes in the brain that are characteristic of Alzheimer's.</li>
                <li><strong>Blood tests:</strong> While blood tests cannot diagnose Alzheimer's, they may help rule out other conditions that can mimic Alzheimer's symptoms.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Early diagnosis is important for planning treatment and making lifestyle adjustments to improve quality of life.</p>

    <!-- Treatment and Management Section -->
    <section class="section">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Treatment and Management</h2>
            <p>There is currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease. However, there are treatments available that can help manage symptoms, improve quality of life, and slow down the progression of the disease.</p>
            <p>Medications such as cholinesterase inhibitors can help reduce symptoms related to memory and cognition, especially in the early to moderate stages of Alzheimer's. These medications work by increasing levels of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in memory and learning.</p>
            <p>In addition to medications, lifestyle changes and therapies can be effective in managing Alzheimer's. Some of these include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Memory care programs:</strong> Specially designed programs that focus on creating supportive environments to help individuals maintain cognitive skills.</li>
                <li><strong>Physical exercise:</strong> Regular physical activity can improve brain function and overall well-being.</li>
                <li><strong>Cognitive therapy:</strong> Cognitive stimulation therapy involves engaging individuals in activities that promote thinking and memory.</li>
                <li><strong>Nutrition:</strong> A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats may have positive effects on brain health.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although Alzheimer's cannot be reversed, these treatments and interventions can help manage symptoms and improve daily functioning.</p>

    <!-- Caregiver Support Section -->
    <section class="section">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Support for Caregivers</h2>
            <p>Caring for someone with Alzheimer's can be challenging and emotionally taxing. It's essential for caregivers to receive support and resources to help them navigate the challenges of caregiving.</p>
            <p>Caregivers should seek support from family members, friends, and support groups. Additionally, there are several resources available, such as caregiver training programs and respite care, which offer temporary relief for caregivers.</p>
            <p>It's important for caregivers to take care of their own physical and mental health. Caregiver burnout is a real concern, and taking breaks, asking for help, and seeking emotional support are critical for long-term well-being.</p>
